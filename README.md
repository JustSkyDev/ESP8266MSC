# Master Slave Communication Library for ESP8266

The **Master Slave Communication** library for ESP8266 is a simplified and user-friendly version of the `espnow.h` library. It is designed to facilitate communication between ESP8266 devices in a master-slave configuration.

## Key Features

- **Simplified ESP-NOW**: This library simplifies the use of ESP-NOW, a protocol developed by Espressif for high-speed, low-power, peer-to-peer wireless communication.
- **Master-Slave Communication**: Enables one ESP8266 device (Master) to control and exchange data with one or more ESP8266 devices (Slaves).
- **Multi-Device Support**: Supports communication with multiple slave devices simultaneously.
- **Data Types**: Supports various data types including integers, floats, strings, and custom data structures.
- **Easy-to-Use API**: Provides a simple and intuitive API for sending and receiving data, abstracting the complexities of the `espnow.h` library.

## Instalation



## Usage

This library provides an easy-to-use API for sending and receiving data. The Master device can send commands or data to the Slave devices, which can respond with data or perform actions based on the received commands.

## Applications

This library is ideal for projects such as IoT devices, home automation systems, sensor networks, and other projects requiring inter-ESP8266 communication.

Please refer to the included examples and API documentation for more detailed information on how to use the Master Slave Communication library.
